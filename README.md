# Week_5_Spaceship_Titanic_Data_Anaylsis_Project
A machine learning project focused on predicting passenger transport success using the Spaceship Titanic dataset. Developed as part of my 5th-week data science intensive.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project tackles the Kaggle *Spaceship Titanic* classification challenge.
The goal is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension
based on personal and travel-related features.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Spaceship Titanic Competition
- Train size: ~8,700 rows
- Test size: ~4,300 rows
- Target variable: `Transported`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Missing value handling
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training & evaluation
5. Kaggle submission generation
